# Back-end task of Code Challenge for Scout base By Bhanwarlal Chaudhary

# NodeJs + Knex + GraphQl + Apollo-Server + Postgres

# Setup project

1. Clone Repo.
2. CD to/repo
3. Update the database configuration in knexfile.js file
4. Run the Following Command
```
npm i -g nodemon
npm i -g knex
npm i 

knex migrate:latest
Knex seed:run

npm start

```

5. For Authorization send `token` in header.

# Given Task Was

This task is for demonstrating your understanding of HTTP, GraphQL, Node.js and general API practices.

Instructions:

1. Implement a Node.js-based server with raw `http`, Koa or Express.
2. Add a `/graphql` endpoint serving the apollo-server or any other GraphQL implementation.
3. Schema must be able to return proper response for the following public query:

```graphql
{
  movies {
    title
    year
    rating
    actors {
      name
      birthday
      country
      directors {
        name
        birthday
        country
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Add support for the following mutation:
```graphql
mutation createUser($username: String, $password: String) {
  createUser(username: $username, password: $password) {
    token
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

5. To expand on the number four, add a mutation-based authentication that accepts:
```graphql
mutation login($username: String, $password: String) {
  login(username: $username, password: $password) {
    token
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

6. Authenticated users may request additional fields for the query used earlier. New `scoutbase_rating` field must return the a random string between 5.0-9.0:

```graphql
{
  movies {
    scoutbase_rating

    title
    year
    rating
    actors {
      name
      birthday
      country
      directors {
        name
        birthday
        country
      }
    }
  }
}
```

7. `/graphql` must be accessible for external clients.

8. End.
